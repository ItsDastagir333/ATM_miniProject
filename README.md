Hello folks,

  Here I have tried to code the interface and services provided by the ATM system as a curiosity.
  This is just a mini project that includes the 
  1) User Authentication using Account No. and stored PIN
  2) After Successful Authentication it offers various Services 
      i) Checking Balance
      ii) Debiting Money
      iii) Showing User Details
      iv) Changing Mobile No.
      
   Some New Features will be added soon
